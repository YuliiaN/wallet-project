# Wallet

Wallet is a single-page finance application with login functionality to track
personal expenses and incomes.

Features: login and registration, expense and income tracking (adding, deleting,
editing), displaying the current balance, the ability to switch the language and
theme from light to dark.

Developed by me: a statistics section that shows the financial situation taking
into account the month and year.
